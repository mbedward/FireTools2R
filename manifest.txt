# Raster Files

* r_fmz.tif - binary raster indicating cells inside and outside Fire Management Zone areas
* r_tsl_sfaz.tif - raster containing time since last fire within the SFAZ areas
* r_vegadv.tif - binary raster indicating vegeation cells with the "Fire Advantage" attribute
* r_vegcode.tif - raster containing vegetation code of each cell
* r_vegfireprone.tif - binary raster indicating vegetation cells with the "Fire Prone" attribute
* r_vegmax.tif - raster showing the maximum fire interval of each cell based on vegetation
* r_vegmin.tif - raster showing the minimum fire interval of each cell based on vegetation
* r_LastYearBurnt.tif - raster containing the last year each cell was burnt
* r_NumTimesBurnt.tif - raster containing the number of times each cell has burnt
* r_TimeSinceLast.tif - raster containing the number of years since each cell was burnt

# Status Output Raster Files

The following raster files include a colour table and attribute table of status codes

* r_heritage_threshold_status.tif - raster containing the output FireTools status code for each cell based on vegetation.
* r_fmz_threshold_status.tif - raster containing the output FireTools status code for each cell based on Fire Management Zone thresholds.
* r_heritage_fmz_threshold_status.tif - raster containing the heritage/vegetation status, with FMZ thresholds overlaid where they exist.
* r_fmz_sfaz_threshold_status.tif - raster containing the FMZ threshold status, with specific SFAZ status codes in SFAZ areas.
* r_heritage_fmz_sfaz_threshold_status.tif - raster containing the heritage/vegetation status, with the FMZ and SFAZ status codes overlaid within those areas

# Vector files

Vectors are provided as GeoPackage files, which are compatible with most recent GIS software.

v_region.gpkg - Polygon defining the region the analysis was constrained within
v_tsl.gpkg - Polygons showing time since last fire
v_timesburnt.gpkg - Polygons showing number of times each cell has burnt
v_tsl_sfaz.gpkg - Polygons showing time since last fire within the SFAZ areas
v_vegBase.gpkg - Base vegetation layer showing vegetation codes, as well as Max/Min thresholds

# Status output Vector Files
